# Eloquent Destination

The UXDM Eloquent destination allows you to migrate data into an Eloquent model. This can be handy if you need to migrate data
into a system using the Eloquent ORM, such as a Laravel project.

For installation and usage documentation, 
see the [UXDM Eloquent repository](https://github.com/DivineOmega/uxdm-eloquent).
